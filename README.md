# Toronto Neighbourhoods Shiny App
Troubling differences in poverty, education and diversity exist among neighbourhoods in the City of Toronto. According to David Hulchanski, a professor of the University of Toronto who uses the 2016 census to create demographic charts of Toronto, the city is segregated by race and income. For example, visible minorities are concentrated in low-income neighbourhoods while white residents are dominating affluent areas. The segregation pointed out by Hulchanski leads to the choices of traits we use to conduct the clustering analysis for the neighbourhoods â€” low-income rate, the population percentage of residents who have no educational certification, and visible minority population percentage. We intend to articulate the social stratification and spatial stratification in the City of Toronto.
